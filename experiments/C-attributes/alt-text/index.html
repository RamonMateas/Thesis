                <strong>Camera:</strong> Sony A1, 400mm f/2.8
            </p>
            <p>
                After waiting three days near a known territory marker, I captured this powerful image of a male tiger emerging from the forest mist at dawn. The soft light creates an ethereal atmosphere.

                <strong>Camera:</strong> Nikon Z9, 800mm f/5.6
            </p>
            <p>
                Photographing birds of prey in flight requires patience and timing. This golden eagle was hunting near its nesting site, and I captured the moment with wings fully extended against a perfect blue sky.

                <strong>Camera:</strong> Canon EOS R3, 100-500mm f/4.5-7.1
            </p>
            <p>
                The annual salmon run attracts dozens of grizzly bears to Brooks Falls. This powerful predator demonstrates perfect timing and technique as it catches a leaping salmon mid-air.

                <strong>Camera:</strong> Sony A7RV, 200-600mm f/5.6-6.3
            </p>
            <p>
                These monogamous birds mate for life. I photographed this pair during their morning feeding routine in the rainforest canopy. Their brilliant plumage is nature's artwork.

                <strong>Date:</strong> September 2024<br>
                <strong>Camera:</strong> Canon EOS R5, 24-105mm f/4
            </p>
            <p>
                Documenting emperor penguins in Antarctica required extreme cold weather gear and special permits. This image shows the remarkable parental care as adults protect chicks from brutal winds.
