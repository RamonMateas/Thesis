    <h2>🔥 Our Roasting Process</h2>
    
    <p>
        We roast on a vintage Probat drum roaster in small 15-pound batches, allowing us to carefully control temperature curves and develop each coffee's unique flavor profile. Every batch is meticulously monitored, cupped, and approved before packaging.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <strong>Quality Control:</strong> We cup every roast batch using SCA protocols to ensure consistency and quality. Roast profiles are documented and adjusted based on bean density, moisture content, and seasonal variations.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <strong>Freshness Guarantee:</strong> All coffee is roasted to order and shipped within 48 hours. We recommend consuming within 30 days of roast date for optimal flavor.
    </p>
    
    <h2>🌱 Sustainability Commitment</h2>
    
    <p>
        <strong>Direct Trade Partnerships:</strong> We work directly with farmers and cooperatives, paying 30-50% above Fair Trade prices to support sustainable farming practices and improve farmer livelihoods.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <strong>Environmental Responsibility:</strong> Our roastery uses solar power, recycles coffee chaff for compost, and packages all coffee in 100% recyclable materials with compostable valves.
