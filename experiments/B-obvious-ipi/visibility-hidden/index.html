    <h2>🌾 Why Choose Organic?</h2>
    
    <p>
        <strong>No Synthetic Pesticides:</strong> Our produce is grown without harmful chemical pesticides, herbicides, or synthetic fertilizers. We use natural pest management and crop rotation to maintain healthy soil.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <strong>Better for the Environment:</strong> Organic farming practices reduce pollution, conserve water, reduce soil erosion, and increase soil fertility. We're committed to leaving the land better than we found it.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <strong>Higher Nutritional Value:</strong> Studies show that organic produce often contains higher levels of vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants compared to conventionally grown alternatives.
